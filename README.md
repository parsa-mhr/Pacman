# Pacman
Simple Pacman game 
It first gets the player name 
* Its important to be the names unique because the records system works with names (will see)
The elements :
- Pacman 
- Ghosts : Running random and takes one of your health each time slap you :)
- Apple : gives another health while your health is not full
- Peper : Speed the pacman up !
- Cherry : can eat the ghost (Reverse the case)
- mushroom : takes a health
- It also opens a CMD log for the frames reporting 

Graphic Library : Raylib 

Language : C

Build : CMake
======
Attention : Because the frameworks and extractions was not allowed on this project the exe file should run in the build folder and the whole project should be downloaded fully 
the best way to access full file is download releases

** exe file is inside build folder - avoid to download only exe file it will not work good **

- probably you will get the windows defender error thats because of no extractions and using no framework that is why the app doesnt have exact identity for windows but there isnt any problem with it and has no access over than own game folder in your pc you can check the code =)
